# School-Inspection-System-SIS-

Problem is to manage the working of school’s inspection system. It’s an existing system which is
already being done by inspection officers manually. They have to do inspection in different
schools and collect data. Areas of inspection are as follow:
 Student Assessment
 Teacher Assessment
 Building Assessment
 Library Assessment
 Computer Labs Assessment
 Non-Teaching Staff
 Science Lab Assessment
 School Council
 Basic Facilities
When Inspection officer collect all the data, officer has to arrange that data and to create reports
of data according different aspects. It’s a lot of paper and it’s very complex to create reports, so
we’ve to build a software for this purpose including modules.
 Online collection of Data
 To create reports and charts of data
 Send Online data to Admin
 Add comments by inspection officer
 Add comments by Admin
The benefits of this software is that officer can easily access app on mobile and can easily insert
data school wise and class wise as well. Platform where without wasting time officer can send
data to admin.
